I am an assistant professor of geomechanics and geophysics in the Department of Geosciences at Utah State University. My group focuses on the mechanics of earthquakes and faulting in the earthâ€™s crust from an integrative perspective, combining insights from laboratory scale friction experiments, multi-cycle rupture models, geophysical and geological observations, and machine learning techniques.
