I am an assistant professor of geomechanics and geophysics in the Department of Geosciences at Utah State University. My group focuses on the mechanics of earthquakes and faulting in the earth’s crust from an integrative perspective, combining insights from laboratory scale friction experiments, multi-cycle rupture models, geophysical and geological observations, and machine learning techniques.
