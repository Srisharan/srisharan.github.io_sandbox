This apparatus consists of a steel load frame with hydraulically driven normal and shear loads. A cumulative normal load of up to 4 MN is supplied through four Enerpac RSM1000 cylinders driven by a 10000 psi hydraulic hand pump. Up to 1.5 MN of shear load is supplied through an Enerpac RSM1500 cylinder driven by a 12000 psi Vindum VP-12K dual cylinder continuous flow pump which can be driven in constant flow rate (displacement rate) or constant pressure (stressing rate) modes. The load frame can accommodate samples of up to 1.2 m fault length and is currently configured to deform sediment/gouge/powder sandwiched between 0.85 m long Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) blocks. Sample averaged shear and normal stresses are measured at the respective hydraulic cylinders via two PX359 10 kpsi pressure transducers. We have the capacity to instrument the fault/blocks with up to ten strain gauge rosettes to measure local shear stresses/strains, eight ILD1320 laseroptical displacement sensors capable of measuring up to 10 mm of slip with 1 μm resolution, and fifteen Panametrics V103 ultrasonic contact transducers, all of which can be operated simultaneously.\nActive/passive ultrasonic system We use an Elsys TraNET EPC computer for ultrasonic (active/passive) data acquisition and storage. The Elsys TraNET EPC performs the acquisition of raw, unfiltered data from 15 Panametrics p- and s-wave transducers at 0.5-50 MHz, and a 20-channel Acoustic Emission (AE) amplifier filters and boosts small signals from sensors. A TiePie HandyScope 5 200 MHz arbitrary waveform generator is configured to provide input signals for data acquisition and storage in active/controlled source mode. A National Instruments NI-cDAQ containing 12 channels for strain input and 32 differetial or 64 single-ended channels for analog voltage input, connected to the TraNET EPC, is configured to sample, record, and save strain and voltage inputs at 10 kHz.\nBenchtop direct/residual shear apparatus The lab operates an electromechanical direct/residual shear system capable of applying up to 2,500 lbf (11 kN) vertical and horizontal load capacity, and deformation rates of 6 x 10-6 to 33 mm/min (0.1 nm/s - 16.67 μm/s). Shear testing can currently be performed on 1\u0026#34; and 2” round samples. The apparatus is configured to record and store normal and shear loads and displacements (4 channels) with the ability to record additional sensors/channels.\nOther resources The lab also utilizes storage and computational resources at the University of Utah Center for High Performance Computing. Additionally, we have access to and frequently utilize MATLAB and Python for data analysis and post-processing, and PyLith for finite element modeling of subduction zone deformation processes.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"9e00a98a725bdf0f804c3b09ae0ed094","permalink":"https://srisharan.github.io/facilities/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/facilities/","section":"","summary":"Large (1 m) direct shear apparatus The lab operates a custom-built 1-meter biaxial deformation apparatus based on the designs of the large biaxial apparatus designed by collaborator Greg McLaskey.

We are interested in how and why earthquakes start, propagate, and stop in the multitude of ways that they do. We can generate smaller, scaled earthquakes in the laboratory and study them closely with a variety of instrumentation to better understand the stresses and frictional properties that are conducive to the generation of various slip modes including earthquakes, slow slip events, and stable creep. Recently, we’ve been interested in the physics and geophysical observations of preseismic slip and postseismic relaxation - using active ultrasonic techniques and acoustic emission monitoring.\n(Some) related publications:\nVariations in p-wave amplitudes and velocities modulated by competing effects of slip and stress Pre- and post-seismic changes in p-wave amplitudes during stick-slips Evolution of frictional state in response to rapid changes in normal stress Mechanics of near-trench deformation at subduction zones Understanding how strain is accumulated and released near the trench at subduction zones is crucial for a better understanding of tsunamigenic earthquakes. Some of our recent work has focused on recasting this problem as a competition between fault healing/restrengthening and tectonic loading. We used this framework to show the origins of shallow slow slip at the northern Hikurangi margin by combining experimentally determined frictional healing and numerically estimated annual stressing rates.\nFrictional and microstructural characterization of fault zones Experimentally determined values of fault frictional strength and stability can be used to better understand the boundary conditions necessary to sustain a variety of tectonic slip modes including elastodynamic ruptures and slow slip. We utilized samples acquired during International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 375 to experimentally constrain the frictional behavior of inputs to the shallow plate boundary at the northern Hikurangi margin. Current and ongoing work is focused on the Wasatch Fault Zone in Utah.\nMachine learning applications to fault zone processes Although laboratory stick-slip instabilities are not nearly as complex as crustal earthquakes, they can be quite complex and somewhat unpredictable. We have successfully used simple machine learning algorithms on geophysical observables such as seismic wave amplitudes and velocities to forecast these stick-slips in cm-scale faults in the laboratory. Current and future efforts will focus on determining whether such methods are applicable to larger, more complex faults in the laboratory and in nature.\nRelated publications: Shreedharan et al., 2022 and Shokouhi et al., 2021\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"https://srisharan.github.io/research/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"My research currently focuses on four main themes and many projects fall under more than one of them:\nProcesses associated with earthquake initiation, propagation, and termination Earthquakes are complex frictional instabilities.","tags":null,"title":"Research","type":"page"}]
